# TVARA

## Description

Tvara, or "The Very Awsome Recipe App", was created to help users find and prepare recipes that they want to make. 

This was done by:

-Utilizing the Materialize CSS framework, Google Fonts, HTML, and Javascript to make a smooth and easy to look at UI.

-Using the "Edamam" API to retrive recipies based off of user input.

-Using the "Tasty" API to get related terms for the recipies.

-Using local storage to save recipies for future refrence.


This was done because:

-Finding the right recipe that fits a users needs can be difficult with tools avalible today.

-Giving users easy and fast access to recipes even for niche categories.
